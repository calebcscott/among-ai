Assumptions:
    Player:
        - any player can report the body (this includes the killer)
        Killer:
            - there is only one
            - will only kill in a room alone with the victim
            - only one person killed per game
            - Kill will be considered only after all players have moved
        Cremates
            - they move randomly among the graph
            - they will only be in a node for 1 interaction

    Algorithm
        - AI will first create fragmented timelines for all players
            ex.
                Player1: {(upper engine, 14), (Medbay, 23), (cafeteria, 34)}
                Player2: {(upper engine, 14), (Medbay, 23), (cafeteria, 34)}
                Player3: {(upper engine, 14), (Medbay, 23), (cafeteria, 34)}
                Player4: {(upper engine, 14), (Medbay, 23), (cafeteria, 34)}

        - Next the AI will generate possible paths that the killer could have taken to and from the body. 
            ex.
                Body found in lower
